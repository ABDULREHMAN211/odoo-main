                                <p> Testing is a software testing technique that automates the process of validating the functionality of software and ensures it meets requirements before being released into production. With automated testing, an organization can run specific software tests at a faster pace without human testers. Automation testing is the application of tools and technology to testing software with the goal of reducing testing efforts, delivering capability faster and more affordably. It helps in building better quality software with less effort.

                                <p>Retrieval of some information on a test can also lead to easier retrieval of related information, at least on delayed tests. Besides these direct effects of testing, there are also indirect effects that are quite positive. If students are quizzed frequently, they tend to study more and with more regularity. Test data can help researchers identify coding errors quickly before the release of a program. It can also help improve the security of programs. Software testing helps in saving the money of the developing organization by detecting defects in the early stages of the software.

                                <p>Automated tests perform the same steps precisely every time they are executed and never forget to record detailed results. Testers freed from repetitive manual tests have more time to create new automated software tests and deal with complex features. Automated testing improves accuracy. Automated testing is a software testing technique that automates the process of validating the functionality of software and ensures it meets requirements before being released into production. An organization can run specific software tests.
